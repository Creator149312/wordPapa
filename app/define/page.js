        you're whispering a secret incantation, and the wizard opens a

        a clear and simple explanation. For instance, if you're
        curious about what "elephant" means, it will say something

        It conjures up real-life sentences where the word plays a
        starring role. If you were investigating "rocket," you might
        see sentences like "The rocket was shooted in the sky." letting
        you visualize how the word 'rocket' is put into action.
